!THIS IS ONLY A DEVELOPMENT DEMO!
That is playground for developer
Please do not download it if you want something playable.

This is NOT a demo of game, as it does not represent planed game feeling and so on.
Game could be completely different.

Also you could find here a lot of bad code, sorry.
My experimental development looks that way.
Final code will be more accurate.
